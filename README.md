## Forestry Model

Model for biomass, based on diameter at breast height (DBH):

$$\mathrm{Biomass} = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \log(DBH)}$$

$$\text{Productivity} = \frac{\Delta Biomass}{\Delta Time}$$

$$\text{Productivity }= \text{f}(\mathbf{X})$$

Factors $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ determine growth rate by species.  A list of approximations can be found [here](https://github.com/frec-3044/machine-learning-template/blob/main/assignment/data/neon_biomass.csv).  An overall approximation for hardwood and softwood can be found in the [Jekins 2003](https://github.com/frec-3044/land-carbon-template/blob/main/assignment/Jenkins_etal_2003_FS.pdf).
